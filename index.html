            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I like to code random things in Python usually, like <a href="https://gist.github.com/T-Perm777/a644e5b1aec069b38bb234e1ba62b806">a rock paper scissors game, <a href="https://gist.github.com/T-Perm777/a70b828e9bcd68e8541a48afb323d9f2">a pizza ordering program</a>, or even <a href="https://gist.github.com/T-Perm777/25f2bf82f4312cd36d6caf6f86f91f5e">a programmer's Russian Roulette</a>.<br> Recently, I have tried out a couple more languages, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>C++</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I do plan on trying out other languages like Javascript, but for now, I want to focus on these three. This makes it easier to focus on one language at a time, making it easier to fully learn and understand that language.</p>
            <h2>Why did I chose coding?</h2>
            <p>I've always had an interest in tech and coding, and I started with Python as it seemed to be the easiest language.<br> I started learnng HTML because I wanted to design my own website from scratch.</p>
            <h2>What next?</h2>
            <p>I have a few plans for what I want to do next, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A tic tac toe website using C++ and HTML</li>
                <li>A database for all the websites I've coded, which I'll have a link for soon on this website</li>
            </ul>
        </main>
    </body>
